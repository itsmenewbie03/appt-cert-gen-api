# TaskList

### ND001

- Create a Report Template
- Create an Endpoint to Generate the Report (this means moving the generation out of from the frontend)
- Choose:
  - Send the filtered data from the FE (more performant!)
  - Send the only filter from the FE and pull the data in the backend
- Optional:

  - If it's easy to implement we would add chart, if not then we will stay with a simple but organized

### ND003
